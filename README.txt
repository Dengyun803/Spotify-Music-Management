Enhancement:
1. Users can log out after they logged in.
2. Users can synchronize their local data(db.json) and data from Spotify.
(i.e.: if a user adds/removes songs in their spotify account, they can click "synchronize" button to add/remove those songs in db.json)
(note: Why Don't You Do Right and Momma is a Revolutionary are only in local playlist, so using "synchronize" will delete them)
